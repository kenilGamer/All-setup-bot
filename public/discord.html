              <b>Welcome to GODCRAFT Discord Bot! We take our server very seriously and with that, we need a good set of rules to go along with it. Please keep in mind that not all of these rules are 100% absolute. Meaning that the context of a situation may change the outcome/punishment. Make sure you take the time to read over this page and check back up on it every now and then when we make changes to it. Please also keep in mind that just because a rule is not written does not mean it is not punishable. There are some things that are just common sense and should be kept that way!</b>
